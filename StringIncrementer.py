# Your job is to write a function which increments a string, to create a new string.

# If the string already ends with a number, the number should be incremented by 1.
# If the string does not end with a number. the number 1 should be appended to the new string.
# Examples:

# foo -> foo1

# foobar23 -> foobar24

# foo0042 -> foo0043

# foo9 -> foo10

# foo099 -> foo100

# Attention: If the number has leading zeros the amount of digits should be considered.
